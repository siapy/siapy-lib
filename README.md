## üìö Overview

__SiaPy__ is a versatile Python library designed for processing and analyzing spectral images. It is particularly useful for scientific and academic purposes, but it also serves well for quick prototyping.

### Key Features

- __Image Processing__: Easily read, display, and manipulate spectral image data.
- __Data Analysis__: Perform in-depth analysis of spectral signatures using advanced analytical techniques.
- __Machine Learning Integration__: Select image regions for training models and segment images using pre-trained models.
- __Camera Co-registration__: Align multiple cameras and compute transformations across different camera spaces.
- __Radiometric Conversion__: Convert radiance to reflectance using reference panels.

To make some of the functionality more easily accessible, a command line interface (CLI) is also provided. See [siapy-cli](https://github.com/siapy/siapy-cli). However, the full functionality can be exploited by using the library directly.

## üí° Installation

To install the siapy library, use the following command:

``` bash
pip install siapy
```

For detailed information and additional options, please refer to the [instructions](https://siapy.github.io/siapy-lib/latest/install/).

## üíª Examples

``` python
from pathlib import Path
from siapy.entities import SpectralImageSet

data_dir = "~/data"

header_paths = sorted(Path(data_dir).rglob("*.hdr"))
image_paths = sorted(Path(data_dir).rglob("*.img"))

imageset = SpectralImageSet.spy_open(
    header_paths=header_paths,
    image_paths=image_paths,
)
print(imageset)
```

For an overview of the key concepts and functionalities of the SiaPy library, please refer to the [documentation](https://siapy.github.io/siapy-lib/latest/concepts/overview/). Additionally, explore the use cases that demonstrate the library's capabilities [here](https://siapy.github.io/siapy-lib/latest/examples/case_study/).
